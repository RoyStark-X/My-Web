            <h3>Tilt-Rotor Mechanism</h3>
            <p>The tilt-rotor mechanism allows the drone to seamlessly switch between rotary flight mode, fixed-wing mode, and ground operation mode, providing unparalleled flexibility:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rotary Flight Mode:</strong> Vertical take-off, hovering, and fine maneuvering at low altitudes.</li>
                <li><strong>Fixed-Wing Mode:</strong> Higher speed and longer range for mid-to-high altitude haze removal.</li>
                <li><strong>Ground Operation Mode:</strong> Buffered landing gears enable stable ground movement for haze suppression in urban and enclosed areas.</li>
            </ul>
